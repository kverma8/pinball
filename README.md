# Vector Pinball

Vector Pinball is a pinball game for Android devices.
It is released under version 3 of the GPL; see [COPYING](COPYING.txt) for the license text.

The graphics are deliberately simple; currently everything is drawn with lines and circles.
The focus is on gameplay and accurate physics.
It uses the libgdx Java wrapper for the Box2D physics engine.
Thanks to Peter Drescher for the sound effects; see [his article on creating them](https://www.twittering.com/webarchive_articles/FMOD%20for%20Android%20-%20O'Reilly%20Broadcast.html).

# How to Translate

Make a new folder in "app/src/main/res" named "values-**_lang_**" (with only at least 2 letters), copy-paste the strings.xml file from the "values" folder into it, and start editing it to the language of your choice.

Also make a folder in "fastlane/metadata/android" with a folder named "**_lang_**" (with only at least 2 letters), and copy the .txt files from "en_US", and simply overwrite them with the description in your own language. The "title.txt" file is entirely optional if you feel like the title could also be translated.
